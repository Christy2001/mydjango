            <h2><a href="">My first food story</a></h2>
            <p>
                This is a story about my love for street food. From hot samosas
                to spicy chicken biriyani, every bite carries memories of
                evening walks and happy conversations with friends.

            <h2><a href="">A taste of home</a></h2>
            <p>
                Home-cooked food has a special place in my heart. The aroma of
                curry, fresh rice, and homemade pickles always reminds me of
                family, comfort, and warmth.
